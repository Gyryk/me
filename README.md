# Me
## My personal website, programmed in HTML5-CSS3 and Vanilla JS

#### I happen to believe websites look significantly better in dark mode, which is why this one was primarily made for dark mode, and I default everything to dark mode.
- The lack of any usable mobile version of the website is largely apparent and will be fixed promptly
- The info might not seem very relevant, I can be clueless sometimes

> The about page is not programmed to be very responsive, sorry about that. <br>
> The entirety of this project is a bit spaghetti code-y, I made it with a bunch of breaks and lost track of what past me was planning 

This version of the website has since been abandoned for an updated one reusing some of the code.
