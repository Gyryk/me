# Me
### This is my personal portfolio website, programmed in HTML-CSS and JS

#### I happen to believe websites look significantly better in dark mode, which is why this one was primarily made for dark mode, and I default everything to dark mode.
- I should probably work on carrying dark mode variable between pages to ensure a better user experience, it's at the top of my list :)

> The entirety of this project is a bit spaghetti code-y, I made it with a bunch of breaks and lost track of what past me was planning 

The projects page is ironically probably the only page without any major flaws, which is sad but hopefully a statement that will be rectified soon

There isn't much else for me to say here that hasn't been said on the website, it's live at https://gyryk.github.io/me
