# Me
### This is my personal portfolio website, programmed in HTML-CSS and JS

> The about page is not programmed to be very responsive, sorry about that.

> The entirety of this project is a bit spaghetti code-y, I made it with a bunch of breaks and lost track of what past me was planning 

The projects page is ironically probably the only page without any major flaws
