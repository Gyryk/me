# Me
### This is my personal website, programmed in HTML-CSS and JS

#### I happen to believe websites look significantly better in dark mode, which is why this one was primarily made for dark mode, and I default everything to dark mode.
- The lack of any usable mobile version of the website is largely apparent and will be fixed promptly
- I should probably work on carrying dark mode variable between pages to ensure a better user experience, it's on the top of my list :)

> The about page is not programmed to be very responsive, sorry about that. <br>
> The entirety of this project is a bit spaghetti code-y, I made it with a bunch of breaks and lost track of what past me was planning 

The projects page is ironically probably the only page without any major flaws, which is sad but hopefully a statement that will be rectified soon

#### There isn't much else for me to say here that hasn't already been said on the website in a much better way, it's live at https://gyryk.github.io/me so go check it out NOW!
